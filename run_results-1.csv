"Cure Cocktail | Capitol Hill Bar & Charcuterie","Nita L.","TLDR: Amazing cocktails and charcuterie boards. Cozy romantic ambience. Horrible service.
I'll start with the pros:
- This hole-in-the-Wall bar in Capitol Hill is family owned and has a wonderful charm of its own.
- With string lights across the bar and candles on every table, this makes for a perfect romantic date spot.
- Cocktails here are impeccable. Don't go by the menu, the menu doesn't list a lot of drinks whose pictures I found on yelp or google. You can just tell the bartender what you feel like having and he will whip something up!
I had the ""what's up doc"" (which is not listed on the current menu), this drink is inspired by Bugs bunny and has carrot juice among other ingredients! A very unique concoction.
I also asked the bartender for a drink with chocolate and egg white, he whipped up a splendid drink that I thoroughly enjoyed.
- With a yelp checkin you get a free cheese and crostini board which was amazing!
Now for the biggest con:
- Service is terrible. They just have 2 people working here who juggle between bartending, cooking and waiting on tables.
- It took a while for them to take our order, even longer to bring us food and drinks and even longer to get the bill.
This was extremely frustrating as a customer. they should really contemplate scaling up.
If I wasn't so much in love with the cocktails, I would've given this place 3 stars."
"Cure Cocktail | Capitol Hill Bar & Charcuterie","Cora L.","Love the charcuterie boards! We ordered a large board for three people, and paired it with a bottle of sangiovese. Favorites were the saucisson sec, lavendar goat cheese, and chorizo. The waiter's recommended pairings were spot on.
Great date night or happy hour ambiance with romantic lighting. There was a cocktail making class happening while we were there, and it looked fun! They were pouring flaming drinks.
Some staff members were more attentive than others, but everyone was really nice."
"Cure Cocktail | Capitol Hill Bar & Charcuterie","Xinyi Z.","This 5 star is for the drink I got. I was here for a corporate event so can't say much about the food items as I only got drinks. Definitely ask the bartender for items not on the menu. I asked for something very chocolatey and this is what I got. Very subtle alcohol taste and it was so yummy! Creamy and light texture with sweet chocolate syrup. The space is quite small but has a couple tables and bar seating space."
"Cure Cocktail | Capitol Hill Bar & Charcuterie","Shirene B.","Cure is an artisan cocktail family owned bar with delicious cocktails and awesome draft beers. Joe can craft tons of cocktails to suit your palette, as well as charcuterie, tapas and sandwiches to munch on while enjoying the relaxing environment. Smooth tones groove during most nights. But sports games request asnd other popular views can be accommadated on their super thin flat screen.
The service is super personable which comes in handy when you want to maybe try something you haven't tried before. They also have cocktail mixing classes during the month that are $35. For that you can score a monthly class plus $5 cocktails on you first cocktail whenever you drop by. Cocktail classes mean drinking your results... Sounds like a bargain to me. Definitely a great place to stop in and have a drink or two before or after a Mariners or Seahawks game."
"Cure Cocktail | Capitol Hill Bar & Charcuterie","Charlene L.","Boards on boards on boards. Charcuterie is on point! Love the freshness of the meat and quality of cheeses, and their happy hour is such a great deal! 50% off a bottle of wine, and a discount of their large board! The scene is minimalist, and it's not super fancy in there, but that's okay when this giant board takes over your entire table. The one thing that definitely sticks out though is the service is horrible. Not that they were rude or anything, but very slow. The place itself is tiny, and there were 3 guys there while we were there. So to say ""understaffed"" I don't think would be the right word to explain it. I think it was just that they weren't very efficient and took forever. To give some context, there were 3 tables of 2 people each, and 3 people at the bar, and we were there for 2.5 hours for our large board and one bottle of wine."
"Cure Cocktail | Capitol Hill Bar & Charcuterie","Brian F.","I came here on a Friday night at 10pm and there weren't a lot of people. It's tucked away across the street from the skateboard park and tennis courts. It's a small space that has maybe 10 bar seats and a couple small tables. The ambiance is very chill and relaxing.
When you check in you get a complimentary crostini/cheese plate. My first drink was the Blue Toronto which was just okay. They have daily specials and on Fridays they have the Classic Manhattan which I also thought was just okay. Both the drinks that I ordered were not very memorable and nothing stood out to me.
A friend says that they have bartending classes and also if you buy a membership you get $5 drinks. However I think it is only on your first drink so it'd probably only be worth if you come often."
"Cure Cocktail | Capitol Hill Bar & Charcuterie","Mimi N.","For anyone who is interested in knowing how to make a cocktail or simply wanting to experience a chillax wine bar, highly recommend hitting up Cure Cocktail!! :)
I cannot express how much fun and enjoyment I get out from the kickass cocktail classes that are hosted here. The owners are super friendly and overall, the classes are kept fairly small and intimate for hands on learning experience. One cool thing to note is if you sign up to a monthly cocktail pass, this allows for free classes, tastings, and other random events that pop up. At a cost of $35/month, it's a pretty sweet deal.
In terms of the place itself, interior is a pretty rustic and cute place. Love the twists on cocktails and the charcuterie board is on point. Had an opportunity to sample the cheese and meats (which does rotate from time to time) and it was delicious! Prices are reasonable and overall, service is nice and quick.
Highly recommend coming here if you're looking for something different."
"Cure Cocktail | Capitol Hill Bar & Charcuterie","Nicole Y.","Overall I love this place. Though I've never been in, I order from here all the time and I LOVE it. I feel like I'm in Europe. Quality that is not typical for a bar. I highly recommend if you want simple but quality snacks and don't feel like shopping or preparing anything. I love that you can go to a bar and find cheeses this premium. My only complaint, and it took everything in me to not mark it a three star because Of this, is their warm cheese plate on their uber eats menu. Aside the fact that my order didn't come with all the described items, the fondita was completely inedible upon arrival. I didn't include this in my rating because I think it's more of a logistics issue than a food quality issue but this item should absolutely NOT be on the to-go menu. The cheese arrived hard as a rock and reheating it only made it harder. Hopefully this will be rectified. In the meantime, I'll stick to the olives, soups, sandwiches, hard cheese/meats, and the homemade pickles."
"Cure Cocktail | Capitol Hill Bar & Charcuterie","Marissa S.","Love the concept of this place-- I'm a charcuterie connoisseur myself! My only concern was that we were the only people in there on a slow Tuesday evening and felt rather ignored by the staff. The whiskey salami, however, is amazing!"
"Cure Cocktail | Capitol Hill Bar & Charcuterie","Annie N.","Cure is a cute, quaint bar hidden in an alley next to a park. It is on the smaller side but we didn't mind. It had a very intimate setting with dim lights and an electronic fireplace at the end. Our waiter was attentive and helpful with any questions we had.
The check in offer on 11/16/18 was amazing. We got a free cheese plate with crostinis and almonds. The goat cheese was rich and creamy topped off with truffle honey, which was basically like crack. We couldn't get enough, and to think it was completely free! We paired our cheese plate with glasses of sangiovese, only $7 per glass.
Overall I'm glad we stumbled upon Cure and had a nice relaxing evening there. I would definitely recommend."

"Cure Cocktail | Capitol Hill Bar & Charcuterie","Lindsey S.","Cute little tapas place. We stopped in around 7 on a Wednesday. I got a glass of wine and husband got the Wednesday night Moscow mule. We also ordered the wild boar meat plate. The duck came out instead but we just kept it. The yelp checkin is also a great deal where you get a couple balls of a soft cheese (I think it was goat) drizzled with honey and toasted bread just for checking in!
There's also a large park across the street for an after tapas walk.
Deducting a star for service. They were all very nice but it was hard to flag somebody down and getting a check was tough."
"Cure Cocktail | Capitol Hill Bar & Charcuterie","Brenda M.","Long wait time for our charcuterie board. Kind of overpriced for the serving size they give you. If you check in with yelp you get a complimentary cheese board and that was really good!"
"Cure Cocktail | Capitol Hill Bar & Charcuterie","Jonathan L.","A great find in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle just across from Cal Anderson park. This quaint, unpretentious bar houses some really great charcuterie, imported with the best flavors in mind. (Spoiler: the fancy karaoke lounge next-door actually gets their food from here.) Millennial magic at its finest, bartender Joe has made some pretty amazing cocktails of his own. I HIGHLY recommend the ""what's up doc"" which will be a weekly treat for myself or the ""bathtub bubbles,"" served in a mini bathtub glass, for those looking for a tasty chuckle.
Happy hour drinks are $8 from 4 to 6 o'clock but the ""drink of the day"" remains $8 all night (take that Seattle establishment). Charcuterie boards are half priced during happy hour as well!
The look of the place is 1930s art modern and the vibe is casual-young-to-distinguished-professional. The service was personable, the charcuterie was great, and the cocktails were some of the best I've found in Seattle.
Disclaimer:
5 stars - Awesome, I would go there every week and recommend to anyone.
4 stars - Really good, I would go there when looking for that type of food and would recommend to anyone.
3 stars - Meh, take it or leave it probably wouldn't come up as a recommendation.
2 stars - Nope, only recommend to enemies and cats.
1 star - I wrote the review from the ER"

"Trübistro","P U.","This spot is very welcoming. The staff are friendly, kind and helpful. If they aren't too busy, they will bring your coffee and snacks to you instead of yelling your order across the shop like other spots.
The coffee is delicious! Not bitter, not too mild, just right.
The ambience is fantastic. Large windows, great lighting, and cozy textures to balance it out.
I've come here several times during the day and always have a great experience.
I'll be going back to try some evening bites with wine soon :)"
"Trübistro","Richard U.","Love this new addition to the first hill hood!
This corner bistro/coffee/wine bar is located in the new senior citizen Murano apts. High ceilings, hip vibe, ample seating always it seems. The coffee seems to be a proprietary low acid coffee roast which seems tasty enough as a drip coffee. Food options are on the lighter side with soup, salads and fancy flat breads. Staff is amazing! They all seem so friendly and take great pride in the place. I like to get work done here and sort or dont want people know about my secret hang out!"
"Trübistro","Peter C.","Trubistro occupies a beautiful space with high ceilings and lots of light. The menu is small, but the food is delicious! I had the caprese flatbread with cherry tomato, basil, mozzarella, pesto and a balsamic glaze. There are lots of tables with power outlets to spread out and do work, or you can sit at the bar with a TV. I will be back!"

"Trübistro","Nik I.","This place was great! Just moved in across the street and stopped by on Sunday afternoon. The space is beautifully curated - very modern, cozy, clean, great music, cool decor and dishes. The woman working was very friendly and attentive. We ordered a delicious charcuterie board and salad, which she appeared to piece together by hand. It was beautiful. It was also a rare semi sunny day and the space has huge windows, so we got to appreciate the weather while eating. At the end we got coffee & espresso which were also done very well. Will definitely come back soon!"

"Due’ Cucina Italiana","Richard U.","3.5 star place!
Interesting casual dining pasta place up in Cap Hill. I was looking to support local restaurants still open during the shelter at home mandate in effect and luckily they are still open for take out.
Stuff tried:
Eggplant parmesan: i am only person i know that actually craves eggplant parm. The version here is not crispy at all but it is exceedingly delicious! My only gripe is that the portion size is tiny. If you are remotely hungry i would order two servings.
Mushroom with truffle oil on healthy pasta: i am a sucker for mushroom truffle oil anything. Chose the healthy pasta which is made from some type of bean flour instead of wheat giving it a toothy consistency. The pasta has touted health benefits but the consistency might be offputting for some folks. Flavor was pretty good however
Bruschetta caprese: nice slab of grilled bread with fresh toppings. I admit that the to go version seems to have left my bruschetta a bit soggy. Eat this first next time"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","Marie B.","I love pasta and have been to just about every Italian spot in Seattle. Handmade pasta, I'm there! Pasta in a casual setting, even better! Most often though, I don't have access to the likes of Il Corvo, Pasta Casalinga, G.H. Pasta, Ristorante Machiavelli, Tavolata, or La Vita e Bella because I currently don't work in Seattle.
However, the very first Yelper I ever met is credited for the recommendation to Due' Cucina Italiana *Bryan K* Clearly, I had been under a rock and late to the pasta bowl party at this popular Capitol Hill/Broadway spot. I've interacted with the two brothers than run DCI, great charismatic business owners. Brilliant concept and business hours until 2200! Great counter staff and efficient kitchen crew. A variety of seating are available whether dining solo, pairs or larger groups. Just remember to kindly bus your table at the end!
My first visit was back in December 2018 (been open since October 2016!) and have been back so many times that honestly I've lost count. This is a long overdue Yelp review as I just had a custom pasta bowl for dunch/linner hours ago (1/27/20).
Assorted fresh pasta that's crafted on site. Your pasta bowl is customized by selecting type of pasta, sauce, and other ingredients from the giant wall signage. Order and pay at the counter, then find a place to sit if dining onsite. There's also brisk takeout and delivery traffic.
In about 15-20 minutes your name is called or check the status on the order monitor. I like to admire my pasta bowl and then dig in while nice and hot. Feeling raveneous, one can easily polish off a bowl. Most often, I have tasty leftovers for another meal.
Another item I've had often (but not today) is their delicious tiramisu. Enough to share, or not!
So thank you Bryan K, Due' Cucina Italiana has become one of my regular spots.
High quality, delicious, affordable, satisfying, highly recommended!"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","Holly L.","The pasta was very tasty! Excellent. If I had eaten on-site, I'd probably rate higher. I love that you can really taste the truffle oil in the mushroom pasta dish. The pomodoro was simple but hit the spot.
However, I ordered delivery through Yelp/Grub Hub and it was an awful wait. On yelp, it said 30-50 min wait time. However I waited 1.5 hours or 40 mins to 1 hour more wait time than I expected. I was tired and hadn't eaten for more than 9 hours so I picked the place that could be the least amount of wait. The restaurant blamed the grub hub driver, and when I called grub hub they weren't taking calls. After my 3rd call to grub hub, they also blamed the driver and gave me a lousy 10% discount for my next purchase.
I'd probably eat here again but NEVER use delivery."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","Julia L.","Had a lovely lunch here recently! The place is modern, clean, well lit (large windows) with plenty of open seating. Remember to seat yourself & bus your own table. My group tried a variety of the sauces...
- traditional bolognese: rich, hearty, filling
- cacio & pepe: the cheese flavor was very sharp and strong, delicious but a bit too much for me
- amatriciana: lots of tomato flavors + smokey, savory goodness in the form of guanciale (cured pork cheek)
- mushroom & white truffle oil: creamy, thick, but not too heavy. Wonder, well balanced flavors between the mushroom and truffle oil (personal favorite out of the 4 sauces)
The pastas were all fresh and perfectly al dente (firm, chewy). Personally enjoyed the rigatoni and ca campanelle best. Would recommend and come back again!"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","Pauli D.","Fresh pasta + mushroom sauce =
----
Every time I go to @duecucina I become more and more of a fan. It's a place that has definitely grown on me. The pastas are light, more my style for lunch, and very very fresh!
----
My favorite at the moment would be the mushroom sauce. Simple and yet the umami really shines through. What do you get here?"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","Edward A.","Friendly staff, in a way. I was told the order line starts near the entrance. I thought i had to order at the food pickup area. Oops.
I had eggplant parmesan. Pretty tasty little appetizer dish. My wife had the only pasta dish that was rated high on the al dente-ish. Those noodles were rather undercooked. Felt like i was eating them raw. But i guess thats what it is by definition? I can definitely see the appeal."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","Yvonne Yiyao X.","Can't believe it took me so long to find this place. Friendly service. Reasonably priced. Food is fast and fresh. Delicious sauce. Pasta is al dente. I loved both pasta dishes and the tiramisu. I see their take out orders coming out rapidly. The store is not super busy or overwhelming. The owner actually cares about his business and was cleaning up here and there. The kitchen is bright and clean - always a good thing to be able to see the kitchen.
Four stars but only because of my love to Il Corvo. This is a place I'll certainly come back soon."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","Brianna F.","We came here on a Thursday evening for a double date to celebrate a couple birthdays and it was packed! Due Cucina Italiana is an order-upon-entry, seat-yourself, and bus-your-own-table establishment. Luckily our friends had arrived earlier than us and were able to snag a table.
The ordering steps are as follows: choose a sauce, choose a pasta, order add-ons or drinks if wanted, sit and watch the screen until your order is ready.
Holy guacamole this place is good! Although the rest of my party ordered the bolognese ragu, I decided on the mushroom and white truffle oil sauce with campanelle pasta and pork sausage. The wait for our food was about 15 minutes, but the food is freshly prepared after your order is placed. The portions are extremely generous for the price, and it's very obvious that the pasta is fresh and perfectly al dente.
I will definitely be back to try the other sauce and pasta options. AND DESSERTS! ;)"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","Derek H.","AMBIANCE
I'm a huge fan of white tile on white grout walls because it really brightens up the place. The servers are super friendly and nice. Food came out in less than ten minutes. It's cool to see all the pasta being made behind the counter. The place is really clean.
FOOD
We went with the Mushroom and White Truffle Oil with Pork Sausage and the Traditional Bolognese both with their recommended pastas. You could definitely taste the freshness of the pasta (not that I had any doubt because they literally make it behind the counter). The noodles had a great bounce, while still remaining a perfect al dente.
The sauces were great, but honestly just didn't fit my preferred palette. Completely a personal thing. The wine hints in the bolognese were too pronounced for my liking. I prefer a meatier and drier bolognese. It was hard to taste the truffle in the other dish. Then again it's $13, you can't expect much. I would have preferred more cream, but again, it's just personal preference!
OVERALL
Great vibe, I love being able to choose different sauces and noodles. I'd come back if I was in the area for a different dish."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","Cristina G.",""
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","Jen L.","My biggest complaint is that our pastas were NOT hot. It was a warm, but not close to hot! Lasagna was hot. We were waiting at the counter before they even called my name since I saw we were next up.
- Mushroom and white truffle with added pork sausage. This was our favorite. My sister's bowl had more sauce than ours, which I think is better as ours was a bit dry. What's with the inconsistency?
-Smoked salmon spaghetti: as you can see from my photo we had very little salmon compared to other customers' photos and the restaurant website's photos. WTH?! It was mostly noodles with a few piece of salmon and a pile of greens. Totally not what everyone else's pics look like.
- Lasagna Bolognese: I've definitely had better. Would probably choose the regular bolognese pasta over this.
- bell pepper bruschetta: too salty, but a nice change from a regular caprese
- tiramisu: delicious!
Pros: fresh pastas are cooked to perfection. Price is on point.
They do not take reservations. You order at the cashier, and then wait for them to call your name. It's really loud inside so there's board that tells you when they are ready for you to come up to the counter to get your food to carry back to your table. And the bowls/plates are heavy. You have to get your own water in the back. Also you are required to bus your own table. So what exactly did I add a tip for? I guess I should have read the other reviews. Maybe that's how they keep their prices reasonable. I was so excited to come here after being in Italy 1 month ago, and chose this restaurant for a night out with friends. With the inconsistency of salmon portion (and mushroom sauce), and failure of the proper temp of the pasta, I feel disappointed."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","Monica L.","I'm not a pasta lover whatsoever. I eat pasta maybe once or twice a year. But I about licked my plate and my friend's plate. Holy moly. I couldn't get enough of my lasagna and her campanelle.
The staff is super friendly too. You pick up your food, grab your own water, and bus your own table. You have to go up to the counter to order too. There's no waiter but nobody cares because the pasta is out of this world.
It's too bad I don't live right above the building. I'm now a total convert."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","Melody Y.","Oh my goodness the food is absolutely incredible here! The pasta is fresh, cooked to al dante perfection, and tasted amazing. I love how they offer sublime quality Italian dishes in a casual environment.
Being from Vancouver, I never thought there'd be a place like this. Wanting Italian food always means paying significantly more for a fine dining experience. Not only is Due Cucina super casual, but the prices are also affordable as well. I highly recommend adding a poached egg to your pasta! Elevates the experience to a whole other level."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","Tracy C.","This was one of the most highly rated restaurants in Capitol Hill so I had very high expectations but I was disappointed. I got the traditional bolognese and I was expecting it to have lots of sauce and flavour but the toppings tasted off and it was too dry. My pasta also took a long time to prepare compared to my friends so I thought it would be super fresh but it wasn't at all. I recommend skipping this restaurant if you're looking for Italian food."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","chara c.","Disappointing. The pasta dough is homemade but machine-worked and the gluten is clearly not worked long enough because it has no chew or ""bite"" to it. My plate of pasta was also undercooked and tough. The sauces were mostly good, except the Amatriciana was a too salty and way too much cheese it was overpowering. It was more casual than expected but that was just fine, as orders were at the front and you picked up your own food. Came out pretty quickly and it wasnt too busy during weekday lunch."
